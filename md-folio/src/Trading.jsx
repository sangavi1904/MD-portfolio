                    Trading 212 is an online brokerage aiming to make the world of trading securities and forex more accessible. Our review of the Trading212 service includes information on the platform, trading fees, the demo account (and pro account), minimum deposit and payment methods. While trading on margin allows you to magnify your returns, losses will also be magnified as they are based on the full value of the position, meaning you could lose more than any capital deposited. Key Transactions through a variety of offerings like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs), Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs), Rights Issues, Private Placements, Block Trades, Pre-IPO Placements, Buybacks etc                    </p>
